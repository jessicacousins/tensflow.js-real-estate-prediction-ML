# TensorFlow.js Real Estate Price Prediction Tutorial

## Description

This TensorFlow.js tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to creating a simple machine learning model to predict real estate prices based on house size and the number of bedrooms. The tutorial employs a sequential model with a dense layer, using the mean squared error as the loss function and gradient descent for optimization. A normalization function is implemented to scale input features to a standard range. A sequential model is created with a single dense layer configured to take two input features. The model is compiled and trained using the normalized features and the actual prices as outputs. The training process involves setting various parameters, such as learning rate, validation split, batch size, and epochs. After training, the model is evaluated by making predictions on new data.
